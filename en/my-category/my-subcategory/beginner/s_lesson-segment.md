### TL:DR: What's the shortest way to sum up this segment? Don't just repeat the title. 

## Use subheadings

These work well to break up the content. 

## Use bullets

Eradicate: 
* Long paragraphs;
* Long sentences; 
* Anything else requiring attention. 

*It's easy to break up existing text. Start phrases with verbs to focus on action items, or turn two or more nouns into a list.*

## Keep it short

Deciding what to put in one segment can be tricky. Keep it simple. If in doubt, add another segment. 

*"Reading on mobile becomes more difficult as the complexity of the content increases." - Nielson Norman Group*
